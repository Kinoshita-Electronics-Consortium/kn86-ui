;; KEC Core — cmp : equality & comparison
;;
;; Kernel ships < <= is. Core completes the set.
;;
;; `=` is value equality. The KEC kernel names assignment
;; `set` (not `=`, as upstream Fe did), which frees `=` for its conventional
;; meaning. `=`, `==`, and `is` are the same comparison: value for numbers and
;; strings, identity for symbols and pairs. `/=` is its negation.
